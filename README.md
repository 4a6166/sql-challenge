Bootcamp: UPENN-VIRT-DATA-PT-06-2023-U-LOLC-MTTH Module 9 Challenge: SQL Challenge

## Description

This database includes simulated data from Pewlett Hackard (a fictional company) describing employees during the 1980s and 1990s.
The base data consists of six CSV files that have been uploaded to a database as represented by the following diagram,

![](EmployeeSQL/ERD.svg?raw=true)

__NOTE:__ Tables `dept_manager` and `dept_emp` actually have a composite Primary Key of `dept_no_emp_no` and `emp_no_dept_no`, respectively. This case is not covered by the capabilities of [Quick Database Diagrams](www.quickdatabasediagrams.com).

Data analysis using SQL answered the following questions:

1. List the employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary of each employee.
1. List the first name, last name, and hire date for the employees who were hired in 1986.
1. List the manager of each department along with their department number, department name, employee number, last name, and first name.
1. List the department number for each employee along with that employeeâ€™s employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
1. List first name, last name, and sex of each employee whose first name is Hercules and whose last name begins with the letter B.
1. List each employee in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, and first name.
1. List each employee in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
1. List the frequency counts, in descending order, of all the employee last names (that is, how many employees share each last name).

## Usage
This challenge includes three reviewed files and several supplemental files.
All challenge files are under the `EmployeeSQL` directory.

Graded files are as follows:
- The file containing the table schemata is entitled [schemata.sql](EmployeeSQL/schemata.sql).
- The file containing the queries to answer the above data analysis questions is entitled [analysis.sql](EmployeeSQL/analysis.sql).
- The image file of the ERD is entitiled [ERD.svg](EmployeeSQL/ERD.svg?raw=true).

Additional files include the data files under the `data` directory and a text file for generating the ERD via [Quick Database Diagrams](www.quickdatabasediagrams.com).

## Instructions
First open and run `schemata.sql`.
Then load data into the generated tables in the order in which they appear in the schemata:
1. departments
1. titles
1. employees
1. salaries
1. dept_emp
1. dept_manager

Lastly, load `analysis.sql`.
This file is broken into eight parts, with each part representing a question from the analysis section.
Each section should be run as a separate query.
Running the file straight through will result in only the last query being displayed, if using `pgAdmin`.

## Requirements
The files for this challenge were generated based on an using [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/14/index.html) and [pgAdmin 4](https://www.pgadmin.org).
